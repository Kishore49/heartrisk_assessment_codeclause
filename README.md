# Heart Disease Risk Prediction


## Description

This project aims to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The web application allows users to input various health parameters, such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and exercise habits, to generate a personalized assessment of their heart disease risk. The application provides insights into the factors that contribute to heart disease and offers recommendations for a healthier lifestyle based on the user's risk profile.

## Features

- Predicts the risk of heart disease based on user input
- Provides personalized recommendations for a healthier lifestyle
- Educates users about the causes, symptoms, and prevention of heart disease
- User-friendly interface with interactive elements

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-risk-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

- Sign up for an account to access the prediction feature.
- Fill out the form with your health details.
- Click on the "Predict" button to generate your personalized risk assessment.
- Follow the recommendations provided to improve your heart health.


## Dataset Details

1. `Age`: Age of the individual (in years).
2. `Sex`: Gender of the individual (M for male, F for female).
3. `ChestPainType`: Type of chest pain experienced by the individual (e.g., ATA for atypical angina, NAP for non-anginal pain, ASY for asymptomatic).
4. `RestingBP`: Resting blood pressure of the individual (in mm Hg).
5. `Cholesterol`: Cholesterol level of the individual (in mg/dL).
6. `FastingBS`: Fasting blood sugar level of the individual (1 if greater than 120 mg/dL, 0 otherwise).
7. `RestingECG`: Resting electrocardiographic results (e.g., Normal, ST-T wave abnormality).
8. `MaxHR`: Maximum heart rate achieved by the individual.
9. `ExerciseAngina`: Exercise-induced angina (Y for yes, N for no).
10. `Oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11. `ST_Slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (e.g., Up, Flat, Down).
12. `HeartDisease`: Presence of heart disease (1 if present, 0 otherwise).
